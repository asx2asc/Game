## Critical Missing Elements in Web App

### 1. **Track System (MAJOR)**
- **Missing**: The signature winding path that defines the board game
- **Impact**: Fundamental gameplay mechanic absent
- **Recommendation**: Implement visible track with numbered spaces

### 2. **Space Numbering (MAJOR)**
- **Missing**: Individual numbered spaces for player progression
- **Impact**: No clear position reference system
- **Recommendation**: Add numbered space system (1-50 as indicated by scoring)

### 3. **Path Visualization (MAJOR)**
- **Missing**: Visual connection between spaces showing player movement
- **Impact**: Players cannot see their progression path
- **Recommendation**: Create visible winding path across island

### 4. **Island Authenticity (MODERATE)**
- **Different**: Green island vs cream/white original
- **Impact**: Visual authenticity reduced
- **Recommendation**: Consider changing to cream/white to match original

## Recommendations for Alignment

### High Priority (Critical for Authenticity)

3. **Enhanced Palm Tree Placement**: More strategic/realistic positioning

2. **Border Refinement**: Ensure border proportions match original
3. **Texture Addition**: Consider subtle textures for authenticity
4. **Animation Enhancement**: Add movement animations along track
